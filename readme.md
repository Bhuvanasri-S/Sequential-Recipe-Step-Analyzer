# Sequential Recipe Step Analyzer 🍳

A **GRU-based sequence prediction project** that predicts the **next ingredient** in a recipe given a sequence of ingredients. This project demonstrates **NLP sequence modeling**, **GRU implementation**, and **interactive deployment with Streamlit**.

---

## Features

- Predict the **next likely ingredient** based on previously entered ingredients.
- GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) model trained on a recipe dataset.
- Tokenization, padding, and sequence modeling for ingredient prediction.
- Interactive **Streamlit UI** for real-time predictions.
- Top-k sampling for more realistic suggestions.
